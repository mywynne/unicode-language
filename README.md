## Unicode Language Entry

This microsite is intended to provide an overview to the options for entering unicode characters. Specifically, this grew out of working with Indigenous languages which have unicode support, but the actual data entry is a barrier to use.

## The Basics

At the most basic level, we want to be able to type in language, and have whatever characters/letters we enter through our keyboard be accurately displayed to anyone who is receiving the text on their end. No missing characters, no distorted or broekn characters, no spacing or alignment problems. 

Not only do we want the text to display accurately, we also want it to be usable in different contexts, eg:
- Changing fonts doesn't break the display.
- Applying some styling, like bold or italics doesn't break the display.
- Other people don't need to install any special software, fonts, or other tools to view the text properly (entering text may require some extra tools).
- The text is properly displayed on different operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS).
- The text is properly displayed in different programs or software (eg: not limited to Microsoft programs).

This includes many moving parts, some of which are more striaghtforward than others.
